# Contributing to Pets Love

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pets Love! ðŸŽ‰ This guide will help you get up and running with the development environment and provide some guidelines on contributing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18
- Git

## Setting Up the Project

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a folder to add the frontend and backend clone
3. Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine.

For run these projects you need use node v20 for frontend and node v18 for API
- install nodemodele with yarn
- Run the project with yarn run dev

In the backend you need run migrations with prisma 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pets-love.git
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/api-pets-love.git
   ```

4. Create docker-compose.yaml

The structure of the folder is: 
/pets-love
/api-pets-love
docker-compose.dev.yaml

In dev we need to create a DB with docker before to run the backend
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db-app:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: petslove
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: petslove
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Map port 5432 on the host to port 5432 on the container
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  pgdata:
```
