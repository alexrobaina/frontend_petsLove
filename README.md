# 🐶 🐱 🦊 Pets Love 🐭 🐹 🐰

Pets Love is a global app dedicated to saving and protecting animals. It aims to assist animal shelters, veterinarians, volunteers, and individuals interested in adopting a pet.

The primary objective of this app is to ensure the ongoing care and well-being of adopted animals. It achieves this by facilitating the continuous flow of information from animal shelter professionals. The app provides precise medical data and pictures of each animal, allowing for the maintenance of comprehensive medical histories and ensuring their health and security.

## 🐶 🐱 🦊 The Shelters 🐭 🐹 🐰

The app empowers animal shelters to maintain meticulous records of animals, generating valuable information such as the adopter's details and the animal's origin. It also enables the creation of accurate medical histories.

Moreover, adopters can contribute to an animal's profile by uploading pictures, which cannot be deleted. This approach promotes responsible adoption practices.

## 👩‍⚕️ The Veterinarians 👨‍⚕️

Veterinarians can efficiently create medical profiles for pets, including essential information such as vaccines, ailment notes, and visit records. These profiles are accessible to the veterinarian's clients.

Rest assured that the profiles of client pets and veterinarian-created profiles are not listed for adoption.

## 👩‍⚕️ The Volunteers 👨‍⚕️

Volunteers can register within the app, allowing shelters to contact them for assistance. By fostering animals temporarily, volunteers can contribute to their well-being and provide updates on their progress. Everyone's help is crucial, as fostering can offer the love and care needed for animals to regain their happiness.

## 😻 The Adopters 🐶

Adopters are individuals who have pets under their care. Each adopter can create a profile for their pets and generate information, effectively creating a life history for each beloved animal.

Additionally, shelters may assign pets to adopters, establishing an unbreakable bond among pets, adopters, and shelters.
