# **🐶 🐱 🦊 Pets Love 🐭 🐹 🐰**

Pets Love is an app created with the goal of helping animal shelters, veterinarians, volunteers and all of those that wish to adopt a pet.

This app will help maintain a continuity of care for the animal after its adoption. The app will achieve this by providing a continuous flow of information from the professionals at the animal shelter. The information will include exact medical data and pictures of our animal friend. This will help keep a medical history of the animal and ensure its health and security.

#

## **🐶 🐱 🦊 The Shelters 🐭 🐹 🐰**

The idea is for the animal shelters to have the capacity of keeping a rigourus registry of the animals, this will help produce valuable information (such as who is the person to adopt the animal or where the animal was found) and also will help produce an accurate medical history.

At the same time, the person who adopts the animal will be able to upload pictures of the animal to the animal's profile without the ability to delete it.

The end goal is to promote the responsible adoption of animals.

#

## **👩‍⚕️ The Veterinarians 👨‍⚕️**

As a veterinarian you will be able to create a medical profile for the pets in a quick and organized way. You will also be able to generate relevant information like vacccines, notes about ailments or the animal's last visit. This is information that will be available to your clients.

And don't worry, the profiles of your client's pets or the ones a veterinarian has created won't be listed in pets for adoption.

#

## **👩‍⚕️ The Volunteers 👨‍⚕️**

Registering as a volunteer, the shelters will be able to contact you. As volunteer you will be able to foster temporarily an animal and share the information about the evolution of its condition. Everybody's help is important, sometimes fostering an animal is to give it the love our friend needs to recover its happiness!

#

## **😻 The Adopters 🐶**

Adopters are all those that have a pet. Any person that has a pet under its care will be able to create a profile for each pet and generate information. This way creating a life history of each little animal.

There's also the possibility that the shelter could asign a pet to the adopters, creating this way an unbreakable link between pets, adopters and shelters.
